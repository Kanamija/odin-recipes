I am finally creating a repository on GitHub and connecting a clone to my local editor VS Code. Although this is all quite boring, I am beyond excited that I am finally learning how to do all of this after my not so great experience trying to learn this with that private tutor. Now that I have connected this file to VS Code I look forward to practicing all my git commands and and push the files I edit up to my GitHub account everyday I work on my first website. I will keep pushing through the boredom and my fragmented attention span and hopefully lear all of this! I will become a website developer before 2027!!
