            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Okonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake made with a batter of flour, eggs, and shredded cabbage, 
                then topped with a variety of ingredients such as pork, seafood, or vegetables. 
                The name comes from the words “okonomi” (meaning “as you like”) and “yaki” (meaning “grill” or “cook”), 
                reflecting its customizable nature. It’s commonly cooked on a griddle, drizzled with a sweet and tangy okonomiyaki sauce, 
                Japanese mayonnaise, and finished with aonori (seaweed flakes) and katsuobushi (bonito flakes).
