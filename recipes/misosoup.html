        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of a savory broth called “dashi,”
            mixed with softened miso paste, and often containing ingredients such as tofu, seaweed, and green onions.
            It is enjoyed both as a daily comfort food and as part of traditional meals in Japan.
