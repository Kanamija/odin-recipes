       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>
        Yaki onigiri are Japanese rice balls grilled until the outside turns golden and crisp.
        This version gets a glossy miso–butter glaze (with a touch of soy) for a umami-rich, restaurant-worthy finish.
        Serve as a snack, side, or party bite—bonus points for a sprinkle of furikake and a shiso leaf wrap.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice (warm, not hot)</li>
        <li>Salt (for seasoning your hands)</li>
        <li>Neutral oil (for the pan or grill)</li>
        <li><strong>Glaze:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white or red miso</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp mirin (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar or honey (optional, helps caramelize)</li>
      </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fancy toppers (optional):</strong> furikake, toasted sesame seeds, finely sliced green onion, shiso leaves, nori strips</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the glaze:</strong> In a small bowl, stir together melted butter, miso, soy, and (if using) mirin and sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the rice:</strong> Wet your hands with water, sprinkle with a little salt, and scoop ~1/2 cup rice. Gently press into a firm triangle or round. Repeat to make 6–8 onigiri.</li>
        <li><strong>Pan-grill:</strong> Heat a nonstick skillet or well-oiled cast-iron over medium. Add a film of oil. Place onigiri and cook 3–4 minutes per side until lightly golden and set. (You can also use a grill—oil the grates well.)</li>
        <li><strong>Glaze & crisp:</strong> Reduce heat slightly. Brush tops with miso-butter, flip, and brush the other side. Cook 1–2 minutes per side more, flipping once or twice, until glossy and caramelized. Don’t rush—let the surface crisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Sprinkle with furikake or sesame, add green onion, and wrap a strip of nori or a shiso leaf around the bottom if you like. Serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
